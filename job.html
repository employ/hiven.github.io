        <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
        dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
        pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
        the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs
        to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the
        same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are
        perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our
        power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being
        able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
        every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the
        claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur
        that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
        man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
        selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or
        else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p><a class=
