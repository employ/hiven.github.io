with Competition and Markets Authority’s industry investigation, changes to the EU audit market and the FRC’s Corporate Governance Code and guidance on audit committees are beginning to have impact.

Strong growth in consultancy for the Big Four firm drove revenues up 6.4% to £2.71bn for the year ended 31 May 2015

The 2015 financial statements show Deloitte continues to grow with revenue of £2.71 billion for the year ended 31 May 2015, a 6.4% increase on the previous year’s revenue of £2.55bn. The firm’s net revenue, after expenses and disbursements, grew by 6.1% to £2.26bn from £2.13bn in 2014.

Across its four main business lines, audit rose 0.3% to £708 million, while consulting revenue grew 10.5% to £687 million. Revenues from its tax and financial advisory service divisions also outpaced audit, with 5% and 9% respectively. The Swiss practice increased its revenue by 13% to £267 million.

The purpose of external audit is to evaluate a company's financial statements to make sure they are true and fair, ultimately inspiring investor confidence.

New Regulations
Within the UK there are already rules in place which limits how long the lead audit engagement partner can work. 
This is reflective of similar legislation in the USA such as sarbanes Oxley, bought in to protect invests after Enron.
New regulations are taking this a step further. 
New EU rules on audit reform were adopted by Council of the European Union in April 2014 which must be incoportated into member states by 17th June 2016.
It’s been adopted by Italy and Brazil adopted it some time ago and China
This amends the Statutory Audit Directive and puts requirements in place for the mandatory rotation of the Staturory audits of public-interest entities.
The UK Government announced that all public interest entities will have to put their audit tender out at least every ten years and change auditor at least every 20 years.
The implications of this are highly significant and it is fair to say mandatory audit firm rotation is not a risk free strategy.
They have led to a material and enduring increase in audit tenders. In two years, more than 50 of Britain’s largest companies have put their audit out to tender. Historically we would have expected to see less than a quarter of that number.

Investor confidence is critical in world financial markets and regulators have been keen to ensure that audit continues to meet that goal. In considering rule changes, governments and officials have had to review the careful balancing of independence, scepticism and objectivity that must exist in the client-auditor relationship.
There are a number of arguments that favour the EU’s stance which mainly emanate from the financial crisis. Although audit partner rotation is already in place in many countries to safeguard auditor independence, these substitutions may not appear effective enough to satisfy the concerns of onlookers. Increasing competition and opportunities for smaller players have also been argued as reasons for trying to create a more level playing field.



This would include EU based companies which are listed on an EU regulated market as well as certain credit institutions and insurance undertakes.

.  The audit tender requirement is in line with that included within the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) final Order implementing reforms of the audit market in the UK which include a requirement that FTSE 350 companies put their statutory audit out to tender at least every ten years.

Mandatory rotation of the statutory audit firm. The legislation will require rotation of the statutory audit firm of a PIE after a maximum of 10 years.2 However, individual EU member states can extend this term to: • 20 years, if there is a competitive tender after the first 10 years; or • 24 years, in the case of a joint audit regime (which currently is only required in France). The legislation provides substantial transition periods for firm rotation, such that statutory audit engagements that have been in place for 20 years or more will have until 2020 to rotate, and statutory audit engagements that have been in place for 11 years or more (but less than 20 years) will be due to rotate in 2023. There is uncertainty around the rotation date for engagements of less than 11 years.

Threats

Revenue
The implications of new regulations will always create uncertainty and could threaten to reduce future revenue.
In this case, specific long term audit clients are being forced to go to tender with alternative suppliers.
One recent example is that PwC was selected as Vodafones audit partner after 26-year relationship with Deloitte as a result of the new regulations.
In 2014 around 56 of the FTSE350 put their audits out for tender in 2014, as opposed to 30 in 2013 and 18 in 2012.
Figures show that around two-thirds of the companies who put audits out to tender have switched firms.
If Deloitte cannot bring in new clients to fill this gap their revenue is likely to fall.
Drop in audit fees to date since the Big Four firms competed fiercely to secure the work.

Quality
Deloitte mentions audit quality as the shared number one priority in the 2014 global report.
These new regulations could put strain on maintaining the high quality audit service for which Deloitte is renowned for..
Data from both the Bocconi report and the University of Illinios suggest that auditor rotation was detrimental to audit quality whilst there is little evidence to the contrary.
This is in part because it takes time to build an understanding of the intricacies of the clients business, process, systems, people and risk.
Audit firm rotation could see the long term, well established Deloitte clients replaced with ones which Deloitte has limited previous experience with.
Evidence suggests that higher rates of fraudulent reporting was reported in audit changeover periods, and with more transient clients this could pose a problem.

We believe mandatory audit firm rotation would reduce, not improve, audit quality. In our view, the costs of mandatory rotation would outweigh the perceived benefits of a required periodic "fresh look" at the financial statements by a new audit firm. Academic studies in both the U.S. and other countries suggest serious disadvantages to mandatory audit firm rotation. Key among them is the loss of the current auditor's cumulative knowledge of the company's business, processes, systems, people, and risks.. The studies suggest these disadvantages will lead to lower audit quality. While studies have limitations, the lack of strong, consistent data linking required changes in audit firms to enhanced audit quality is striking. The significant implications for audit quality of mandatory audit firm rotation are clear. We believe the Board should pursue other measures that will improve audit quality and thus benefit investors

Resource
Conducting a thorough audit is a very time consuming task.
Increased costs for the time management spends during a transition on educating the new auditors on the company’s operations, systems, business practices and financial reporting processes.
Companies will likely need to devote more time to helping the new auditor learn about their business and accounting systems
The process of tendering is also time consuming.
This increase in time will put strain on existing resources. 

--

the cost of client support would also increase to support the auditors
And what do the auditors have to say about mandatory rotation if in fact there is an opportunity to increase audit fees? This time, the auditors seem to be decidedly in agreement with corporate America. More specifically, Deloitte and Touche (the only Big Four firm to have responded in writing to the proposal) makes clear that they really don’t think auditor rotation will cut it when it comes to ’. CEO Joe Echevarria, commenting on behalf of Deloitte, concludes the following based on ‘an objective assessment of the literature on mandatory rotation’:
Research studies show that restatements and frauds are less likely to occur with longer auditor tenure.
The majority of studies on mandatory rotation reach an unfavourable conclusion on the balance between costs 
and benefits.
If mandatory rotation were required at the 
500 largest US companies, a 10-year phase-in process would entail 50 auditor changes every year compared to the recent average rate of five per year.
The economies and capital markets of countries that have adopted mandatory rotation are not directly comparable to those of the US. Some countries that have adopted the policy have discontinued or curtailed it. Research that is available tends to be unfavourable on the effects of mandatory rotation.

Opportunities

Market stagnation
80% of established FTSE 350 10-year plus companies have not changed auditors in the last 10 years, some for not over 100 years.
Deloiite have been investing significant money in their audit offering but it may not receive the market penetration
When a company chooses a auditor, there seems to be little momentum to change.
FTSE companies may now be exposed to Deloitte's services when previously they were not. If deloitte can offer a competitive service, supported by audit partners etc. 
PwC's 32 year Tesco audit reign ends as Deloitte appointed.
There is also benefits for more clients exposure, within different industries, which might help.

There is 56 audit tenders of FTSE 350 companies this year, compared with 30 in 2013 and 18 in 2012.

Only 40 FTSE companies changed their auditor in the decade to 2011, according to Proxima. Between 2011 and 2014, 85 companies changed their auditor, including 46 FTSE companies in 2014 alone, Proxima said.

Barriers to entry
The tendering process has associated costs and there is now a limit on how long that audit contract will run.
Furthermore the 
The new reforms could help the big four capture an even bigger share of the market Increased barriers to entry in the form of tendering  
for new contracts could be so prohibitive, that smaller firms might not be able to enter the market, and so, ironically, "these reforms could help the Big Four firms capture an even bigger share of the market".

Client Exposure

Conclusion
It’s clear that this change in legislation introduces both threats and opportunities for Deloitte.
Many would argue that there is not a clear case for quality improvements and that the costs outweigh the benefits.
Deloitte is bringing in significant investment and innovation to the audit
