# Delivering at Pace

Effectiveness in this area means focusing on delivering timely performance with energy and taking responsibility and accountability for quality outcomes. For all staff, it’s about working to agreed goals and activities and dealing with challenges in a responsive and constructive way. 

# Project Management Plan 	
The project management plan (PMP) brings together all the plans for a project. The purpose of the PMP is to document the outcomes of the planning process and to provide the reference document for managing the project. The PMP is owned by the project manager. 

# Project Reviews
Project reviews take place throughout the project life cycle to check the likely or actual achievement of the objectives specified in the project management plan (PMP) and the benefits detailed in the business case. Additional reviews will take place following handover and closeout to ensure that the benefits are being realised by the organisation. 

# Scope Management
Scope management is the process by which the deliverables and work to produce them are identified and defined. Identification and definition of the scope must describe what the project will include and what it will not include, i.e. what is in and out of scope. 

# Methods & Procedures
Methods and procedures detail the standard practices to be used for managing projects throughout a life cycle. Methods provide a consistent framework within which project management is performed. Procedures cover individual aspects of project management practice and form an integral part of a method. 

# Delivering Value for Money
This means seeking out and implementing solutions which achieve a good mix of quality and effectiveness for the least outlay. For the public sector delivering value for money involves the efficient, effective and economic use of taxpayers’ money in the delivery of public services. (For those joining from outside the public sector relevant examples will be considered)
