# Scope Management
Scope management is the process by which the deliverables and work to produce them are identified and defined. Identification and definition of the scope must describe what the project will include and what it will not include, i.e. what is in and out of scope. 

# Methods & Procedures
Methods and procedures detail the standard practices to be used for managing projects throughout a life cycle. Methods provide a consistent framework within which project management is performed. Procedures cover individual aspects of project management practice and form an integral part of a method. 

# Delivering Value for Money
This means seeking out and implementing solutions which achieve a good mix of quality and effectiveness for the least outlay. For the public sector delivering value for money involves the efficient, effective and economic use of taxpayersâ€™ money in the delivery of public services. (For those joining from outside the public sector relevant examples will be considered)
